# TeXify

Turn your handwritten math into LaTeX — instantly, right in your browser.

## What it does

Draw or upload a photo of a math equation, and TeXify converts it to clean LaTeX code you can copy and paste anywhere.

## Why it's cool

- **Runs locally** — everything happens in your browser, nothing gets sent to a server
- **Privacy first** — your images never leave your device
- **No setup** — just open and use

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Built with

- React + Vite
- [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) with the Xenova/texify model
- Runs entirely in a Web Worker for smooth performance
